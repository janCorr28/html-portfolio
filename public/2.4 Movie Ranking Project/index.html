<h1>Koraycan's Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>The Most Enjoyable Movies I've Ever Seen</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Singin'in the Rain (1952)</h3>
<p>This movie is meaningful to me. Creating a small universe where art gives people wings so they can reach freedom or love...</p>
<h3>Vatel (2000)</h3>
<p>Liked this movie not because of its story based on French history. I am very impressed by the acting and masterful cinematography behind it.</p>
<h3>Joe Somebody (2001)</h3>
<p>Two things are special to me about this movie. It is simple and geniune. That's all. </p>
